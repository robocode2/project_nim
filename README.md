- CS50 AI - Project 4.b Nim https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/4/nim/
- Problem Description: Using reinforcement learning to train AI to play a game of NIM
- Area of AI: Machine learning
- Applied Algorithms: Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm, epsilon-greedy algorithm
- Results: the AI wins every time after being trained on 10,000 games (if human is player 1). Human player can win if the player knows the winning strategy of the game of Nim and plays 2nd.
